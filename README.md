# yash - Yet Another Shell

This is a job-control shell written in C as a part of my Operating Systems EE379K software Engineering class at the University of Texas.

lab1 is an incomplete first attempt.

lab1_2 is the finished working verison.

The features of this shell include
  * handling of sigint, sigstp, and sigchld signals for processes
  * ability to run jobs in the fg and bg
  * ability to move jobs from bg into fg, and vice versa 
  * I/O redirection including piping data from one job to another or writing/reading of files
